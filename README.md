# iPinga Starter Application #

This simple application is a boiler plate for starting a new iPinga application.  The framework should be installed
via `composer` after you copy the public_html folder in this project to your server's document root folder.

There is a startingpoint.sql file that you can use with PhpMyAdmin to create the starting database.  The username is
`you@example.com` and the password is `qwerty` when you first try to start this application.
